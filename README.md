  <p align="center">
   Skill deals is an app to connect people who would like to barter services.  Users can either post an offer of a service they would trade, or they can post a request for a service they are in need of.  If the user finds an offer or request they are interested in, there is a messaging feature enabled to connect the users in a private chat room for conversations.

## Overall Structure

### Back End
The app was built using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Python on the back end with a PostgreSQL database. The backend structure is RESTful API. Model associations are used to minimize database queries to the backend, assuring speed and reliability.

### Front End
The front end is built with React and Javascript while utilizing Redux architecture, producing a lightning-fast user interface and calling upon dynamically rendered components.

## Challenges

- This app features the Haversine formula for calculating distance.  While I can't take credit for the amazing formula, implementing it without drastically slowing my site was a hurdle.

- This app also features a messaging feature.  This feature did not need to be robust, and also needed to be custom fit for the app.  I built my own messaging page with private chat rooms without the use of websockets (yet).  This was a challenge, but I do plan on expanding this feature.

- This app is a mixture of dynamic elements and rendered ones.  A large challenge was finding the right combination of useEffect functions and their dependency arrays.

- This app also features multiple modals.  Implementing those so that the data was passed between them was a bit of a blocker.  I was able to also implement these with a mixture of dynamic and rendered elements.
